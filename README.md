# DNS-Spoofing-Tool

This is a Tool that provides various network-related functionalities such as DNS spoofing, ARP spoofing, port scanning, and OS fingerprinting.

## Features

- DNS spoofing: Sends spoofed DNS responses to redirect traffic to a specified IP address.
- ARP spoofing: Performs ARP spoofing to intercept network traffic.
- Port scanning: Scans for open ports on a target IP address.
- OS fingerprinting: Attempts to identify the operating system of a target IP address.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install the Scapy library using pip:
   ```
   pip install scapy
   ```

## Usage

To use the script, run the following command:
```
python Dyro.py -t <target_ip> -g <gateway_ip> -m <mode>
```

Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of the target machine, `<gateway_ip>` with the IP address of the gateway, and `<mode>` with the desired mode (`dns`, `arp`, `port`, or `os`).

## Modes

- `dns`: Performs DNS spoofing.
- `arp`: Performs ARP spoofing and restores the ARP tables after 10 seconds.
- `port`: Performs port scanning.
- `os`: Performs OS fingerprinting.

## Example

To perform DNS spoofing on a target IP address `192.168.1.100` with a gateway IP address `192.168.1.1`, run the following command:
```
python script.py -t 192.168.1.100 -g 192.168.1.1 -m dns
```

To perform ARP spoofing on a target IP address `192.168.1.100` with a gateway IP address `192.168.1.1`, run the following command:
```
python script.py -t 192.168.1.100 -g 192.168.1.1 -m arp
```

To perform port scanning on a target IP address `192.168.1.100`, run the following command:
```
python script.py -t 192.168.1.100 -g 192.168.1.1 -m port
```

To perform OS fingerprinting on a target IP address `192.168.1.100`, run the following command:
```
python script.py -t 192.168.1.100 -g 192.168.1.1 -m os
```
